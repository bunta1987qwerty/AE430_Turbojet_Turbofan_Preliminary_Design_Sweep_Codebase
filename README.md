# AE430_Turbojet_Turbofan_Preliminary_Design_Sweep_Codebase
This repository contains a Python-based parameter sweep tool used for an AE 430 final project.   It evaluates candidate turbojet and turbofan designs by varying cycle/component parameters, screening constraints, and ranking feasible designs by the project cost function.
